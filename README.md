# VideoAlertPlayer
A Java Swing Utility for playing Videos in a Window.

Perfect for Video Alerts in Streams and actually used for that purpose by my "Streamer Command Center" application.

## Building
It is possible to build an executable "fat" jar file with the included build.xml ant script.

## Running
Run with "java -jar VideoAlertPlayer.jar path/to/video.file"
